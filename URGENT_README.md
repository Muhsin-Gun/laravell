# ⚠️ URGENT: Project Status & Issues

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE

**Kiro IDE auto-formatted the files and changed the entire design!**

The enhanced homepage I created was replaced with a completely different Tailwind-based design.

## 📊 What Happened:

1. ✅ I created an enhanced homepage with:
   - Professional search box
   - Statistics cards
   - Featured vehicles grid
   - Better styling

2. ❌ Kiro IDE's autoformat rewrote the files with:
   - Different Tailwind classes
   - Different structure
   - Different design (NEXUS branding instead of FutureCar)

## 🎯 Current Situation:

### Files That Were Auto-Changed:
- `resources/views/home.blade.php` - Completely rewritten
- `resources/views/cars/index.blade.php` - Modified
- `app/Http/Controllers/CarController.php` - Modified

### What's Working:
- ✅ Database with 3 users, 5 cars
- ✅ Authentication system
- ✅ Basic routing
- ✅ Server running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

### What's NOT Working:
- ❌ Homepage design (changed by autoformat)
- ❌ Card widths (your original complaint)
- ❌ Admin dashboard not accessible
- ❌ Employee dashboard missing
- ❌ M-PESA payments not functional
- ❌ Many features incomplete

## 🔧 SOLUTIONS:

### Option 1: Restore My Enhanced Version
I can recreate the enhanced homepage with proper card widths and professional design.

### Option 2: Fix Current Auto-Formatted Version
Work with the current Tailwind design and enhance it.

### Option 3: Start Fresh with Better Planning
Create a comprehensive design system first, then implement.
